Hello! My name is Kamrun Nahar and I am from Brooklyn, NY.

The following test script is to demonstrate how a user can go to Amazon and search for a pair of sunglasses specifically from the brand Oakley, and add in two units of their selected choice to their cart.

The test scenario consists of the user already having an Amazon account and being logged in.

The beginning of the code opens up the Amazon web application, using Google Chrome. The window is then maximized. The user will proceed to clicking into the search bar located on the top of the website and will type in "oakley sunglasses" and will click on the magnigying glass symbol next to the search box which is an icon to search. After sucessffully being able to search for oakley sunglasses, the user in this specific scenario will scroll slightly and select the pair of sunglasses shown in the image above. The user makes this selection by clicking on the hyperlink which has the name of the product.

The user will then be redirected to a new page, and will be able to change the quantity of sunglasses to 2 but clicking on the drop down button. After this successful step is completed, the user will click on the add to cart button, which is automatically submit 2 quantities of the selected pair of sunglasses to their cart, and will take the user to a new page.

The test ends here, as we were able to successfully add 2 units of the selected pair of oakley sunglasses to the cart.
